            <li>
                Satyagraha first became a political movement in 1920, transforming Gandhi into a prominent figure in Indian consciousness.Satyagraha is about "soul force" or "silent force," refusing to use brute force.
            </li>
            <li>
                Nonviolence is a central ethical value in Indian thought, which Gandhi adapted for political use.

                <li>
                    Gandhi emphasized that "God is Truth," later modifying it to "Truth is God," equating truth with the universal Being (Brahman, Atman).
